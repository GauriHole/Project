Task :- Analyzing Customer Reviews(Messho_Site)

1. Business Objective:- The main goal is to study customer reviews of a product to understand their opinions. 
   This helps in making improvements to the product based on what customers are saying.

2. Constraints:- 
    2.1 The data must be collected legally, like using Amazon's API or by following the websiteâ€™s rules for scraping.
    2.2 Since feedback changes over time, it may be necessary to get new reviews regularly to stay updated.

3. Data Dictionary:-
    3.1 ReviewText:  (Text) The written feedback from customers, very important for understanding customer feelings.
    3.2 ReviewRating: (Number) The rating given by customers (out of 5), which can help show overall satisfaction.

4. Data Pre-Processing and Extraction:- The Python code is used to collect reviews and ratings from a product page on Meesho. Here's what the code does:
    4.1 It sends a request to the product page like a web browser.
    4.2 It uses `BeautifulSoup` to read and understand the webpage content.
    4.3 It finds the sections where reviews and ratings are mentioned.
    4.4 It cleans up the data by removing extra spaces and making sure the number of reviews and ratings match.
    4.5 Finally, it saves this information into a table (DataFrame) and stores it in a file called `reviews_and_ratings.csv` for easy access.

With this data, we can analyze customer feedback, helping us better understand their experiences and improve the product based on their input.
